Alright
We will continue to refine the front part of the app first
I'm fine with 4pm on Friday. Sorry cannot commit the valuable parts yet, but I already had the concepts about the princples of Android, and for now I'm trying to go through how our app works on Android Studio. If possible I'm going to undertake tasks next week:)
It's ok Betty :) for now I will need your help managing Facebook. And twitter and even instagram
Like preparing the marketing side before launch
